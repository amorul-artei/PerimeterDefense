# PerimeterDefense


A video analysis project (initially Python, but I intend to move/write critical analysis components to C++).
The analysis as a whole is aimed specifically at addressing the needs of psychotronics abuse: criminal investigation.

However, many modules, separately or together, can be find useful by many others, whether TIs or not.

The idea is to have good tools that are able to correlate all aquired data (video, audio, EMF, other sensors) to finally
resolve once and for all the criminal abuse perpetrated with advanced, undisclosed technologies. This crime is in the same
area as "Havana Syndrome".
